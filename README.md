# Wine-Quality-Predictor

Dashboarding is a method to present data in a visually appealing and interactive manner. It displays large amounts of data in an easy-to-understand format for quick analysis and decision-making. Dash-
boards are used in businesses, organizations, and government agencies to provide real-time insights and monitor key performance indicators. Dashboards typically consist of one or more graphical forms,
such as charts, graphs, or maps, that display data in a meaningful way. These visualizations can be customized and interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific data points, filter data, or change
the view of the data.
In this Project I used the Wine Quality dataset (winequality-red.csv) from UCI Machine Learning Repository to build an interactive dashboard using the Python libraries, such as Dash, Plotly, and
Seaborn, and use logistic regression to predict wine quality.
